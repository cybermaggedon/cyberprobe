.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cybermon
is a configurable network packet stream analyser.  It is designed to
receive packets from
.B cyberprobe,
analyse them and generate
session/transport level events which result in user-configurable
actions. For each event, a call is made to a Lua script which the caller
provides.
.TP
.B -h, --help
displays command line help.
.TP
.B -t, --transport\fR=\fITRANSPORT\fR
specifies transport:
.B tcp
for simple TCP transport, or
.B tls
to require clients to connect using TLS.  Default is
\fBtcp\fR.
.TP
.B -p, --port\fR=\fIPORT\fR
specifies TCP port number to listen on.
.TP
.B -K, --key\fR=\fIKEY-FILE\fR

for a known trusted CA.
.TP
.B -p, --pcap-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR

.SH "LUA EVENT CALLS"
The configuration file is expected to provide the following functions,
which are called in response to cybermon events.
.TP
.B trigger_up(liid, address)
Called when an attacker is seen coming on-stream. The liid parameter
describes the target ID, and address contains the IP address in string
form.
.TP
.B trigger_down(liid)
Called when an attacker is seen going off-stream. The liid parameter
describes the target ID.
.TP
.B connection_up(context)
Called when a stream-based connection (e.g. TCP) is made. The context
parameter is a LUA userdata variable which can’t be access directly,
but can be used with the functions described below to access further
information from cybermon.
.TP
.B connection_down(context)
Similar to connection_up, called when a connection closes.
.TP
.B icmp(context, data)
Called when an ICMP message is detected. The data parameter contains
the ICMP message body.
.TP
.B http_request(context, method, url, header, body)
Called when an HTTP request is observed. The HTTP method and URL are
described in the method and url parameters. The header parameter is a
LUA table, which describes the HTTP header key/value pairs. If there
is an HTTP payload in the request, it is contained in the body
parameter, which is a string. Otherwise body will be an empty string.
.TP
.B http_response(context, code, status, header, url, body)
Called when an HTTP response is observed. The HTTP response code and
status are described in the code and status parameters. The header
parameter is a LUA table, which describes the HTTP header key/value
pairs. If there is an HTTP payload in the response, it is contained in
the body parameter, which is a string. Otherwise body will be an empty
string.
.TP
.B smtp_command(context, command)
Called when an SMTP command is observed i.e. a single line message
going to the server from a client. The command parameter contains the
command string.
.TP
.B smtp_response(context, status, text)
Called when an SMTP response is observed. That is, status going from
server to client following a command. The status parameter is the
status number e.g. 200. The text parameter contains the response text,
described as a list of strings. Responses may occur over a number of
lines, hence the parameter is a list: For single-line responses, there
is only a single item in the list.
.TP
.B smtp_data(context, from, to, data)
Called when an SMTP payload is observed i.e. the body of text
following the DATA command. To aid processing, the SMTP protocol
processor assembles information from other commands: the from
parameter contains the email From address described in the MAIL FROM
command. The to parameter is a list of addresses contained in all RCPT
TO commands. The data parameter contains the email body - it will be
an RFC822 payload.
.TP
.B ftp_command(context, command)
Called when an FTP command is observed i.e. a single line message
going to the server from a client. The command parameter contains the
command string.
.TP
.B ftp_response(context, status, text)
Called when an FTP response is observed. That is, status going from
server to client following a command. The status parameter is the
status number e.g. 200. The text parameter contains the response text,
described as a list of strings. Responses may occur over a number of
lines, hence the parameter is a list: For single-line responses, there
is only a single item in the list.
.TP
.B dns_message(context, header, queries, answers, auth, add)
Called when a DNS message is observed. The decoded DNS message is
described in the parameters: header is the DNS header, queries
contains the DNS queries, answers contains the answers in a response
message, auth contains DNS nameserver authority descriptions, and add
provides additional information.
.TP
.B unrecognised_datagram(context, data)
Called when a datagram is received using a protocol which isn’t
recognised. Currently, only DNS and ICMP are recognised. Any other UDP
protocol results in a call to this function.
.TP
.B unrecognised_stream(context, data)
Called when connection-orientated data is received using a protocol
which isn’t recognised. Currently, only HTTP, SMTP and FTP are
recognised. Any other TCP protocol results in calls to this function
whenever data is observed.
.SH "CONTEXT OBJECT"
From the LUA code there, the context variable has a number of method
functions which can be called:
.TP
.B context:get_type()
Returns the protocol type of the context e.g. http, tcp, udp, dns,
ip4
.TP
.B context:get_parent()
Returns the parent context relating to a context. This can be used to
travel "up" the protocol stack. For example, call get_parent on a TCP
context will return the IP context.
.TP
.B context:get_src_addr()
Returns the source address relating to a context. Returns two string
variables: the first is the address class e.g. ipv4, the second is the
address value e.g. 1.2.3.4.
.TP
.B context:get_dest_addr()
Returns the destination address relating to a context. Returns two
string variables: the first is the address class e.g. ipv4, the second
is the address value e.g. 1.2.3.4.
.TP
.B context:get_reverse()
Returns the context relating to the "other side" of a communication,
but only if this has been identified. On an HTTP response, get_reverse
will return the HTTP request. In the http_request function you will
not be able to use get_reverse to find the HTTP response because the
response does not exist at the point the request is identified.
.TP
.B context:get_id()
Returns a context’s unique ID. Can be useful for tracking, or can be
used as index into your own LUA structures to associate information
with contexts.
.TP
.B context:describe_src()
Returns a human readable description of the protocol stack using source
addresses.
.TP
.B
context:describe_dest()
Returns a human readable description of the protocol stack using
source addresses.
.TP
.B context:get_liid()
Returns the trigger ID associated with a "target".
.TP
.B context:get_network_info()
Returns two variables: the source and destination network addresses
(IP addresses) for this data. These are in normal IP address string
format.
.TP
.B context:get_trigger_info()
Returns the IP address which triggered this collection, if known. If
not, 0.0.0.0x is returned. This is in normal IP address string format.
.TP
.B context:forge_tcp_reset()
Creates a TCP reset packet and directs it at the source address
associated with this context. Must have TCP protocol present in the
stack.
.TP
.B context:forge_dns_response(header, queries, answers, add)
Creates a DNS message and directs it at the source address associated
with this context. The provided parameters are used as protocol data
in the DNS encoder.
