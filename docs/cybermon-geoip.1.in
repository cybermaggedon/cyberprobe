.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cybermon-geoip
[ \fIEVENT-PUBLISHER\fR [ \fIEVENT-SUBSCRIBER\fR ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cybermon-geoip
subscribes to a cybermon event stream. Such a stream is generated by running
.B cybermon
with the
.B zeromq.lua
configuration file.  Received events have IP addresses looked up in a GeoIP
database, and any addition location information is added to events before
re-publishing.

The arguments specify a ZeroMQ publisher to subscribe to, and subscriber to
publish to, respectively.  They are typically of the form:
\fBtcp://\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR, and default to
\fBtcp://host1:5555\fR and \fBtcp://host1:5556\fR respectively.
